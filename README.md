# SwiftzerlandTransportAPI
A Swift 4 Codeable API for the [OpendataCH TransportAPI](https://github.com/OpendataCH/Transport), which offers free REST access to public transportation timetables in Switzerland.

The Swift interface provided will ony work with Swift 4. It contains very little error checking, depending on the calling functions to ensure appropriate values for the parameters and passing them straight through to the foundation calls.
